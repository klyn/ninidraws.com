      <h1>About Nini Programming Language & Code Editor</h1>
      <p>
        Nini is a simple programming language that is primarily made to help
        non-programmers learn the basics of computer programming. In this
        context Nini’s target demographics are young students and people who
        haven’t had much exposure to -- or experience with, tech or more
        specifically, personal computers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Given many schools and people without great computer skills don’t have
        access to up-to-date hardware and software, Nini’s code editor has been
        made using legacy techniques and technologies, to increase the chance of
        it being able to run on older hardware and software.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nini also could be useful to others, regardless of their tech literacy.
        For example, many artists could potentially use Nini to create either
        artwork or even graphics that could be useful in various applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nini is a new programming language and it is still under active
        development with a large to-do list of features and bug fixes. This
        means both core language features and its code editor could be updated
        weekly, if not daily. Also since the current version is 0.1-alpha,
        breaking changes could be introduced at any point.
      </p>

      <p>
        Initially, Nini was inspired by a programming language called Design by
        Numbers, DBN, which was created at MIT Media Lab during the 1990s;
        However, it very quickly found its own set of aims and goals and besides
        some keywords and basic concepts, shares no other similarities with DBN.
